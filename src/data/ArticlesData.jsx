          For well over 100 years, researchers have labored tirelessly to
          understand how humans learn and remember. The resulting scientific
          literature is impressive, both in its scope and its depth. In fact, so
          much is now known that I doubt that any human could read and absorb
          all that has been written on the subject. The sad irony, though, is
          that it’s often not obvious how to use the findings of all of this
          research in educational settings.

          Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order for the
          “American AI Initiative,” to guide AI developments and investments in
          the following areas: research and development, ethical standards,
          automation, and international outreach. This initiative is indicative
          of the changing times, and how, as a country, the U.S. is learning to
          navigate the implications of AI. Leaders in the business world,
          specifically, are faced with the responsibility of equipping our
          employees with the skills necessary for paving long-lasting career
          paths, and the workforce must discover what will be expected as
          technology continues to disrupt the norm, and work as we know it.
