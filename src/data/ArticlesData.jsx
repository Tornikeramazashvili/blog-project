              Unfortunately, since nobody knows how the world will look in 2050
              – not to mention 2100 – we don’t know the answer to these
              questions. Of course, humans have never been able to predict the
              future with accuracy. But today it is more difficult than ever
              before, because once technology enables us to engineer bodies,
              brains and minds, we can no longer be certain about anything –
              including things that previously seemed fixed and eternal.

            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              A thousand years ago, in 1018, there were many things people
              didn’t know about the future, but they were nevertheless convinced
              that the basic features of human society were not going to change.
              If you lived in China in 1018, you knew that by 1050 the Song
              Empire might collapse, the Khitans might invade from the north,
              and plagues might kill millions. However, it was clear to you that
              even in 1050 most people would still work as farmers and weavers,
              rulers would still rely on humans to staff their armies and
              bureaucracies, men would still dominate women, life expectancy
              would still be about 40, and the human body would be exactly the
              same. Hence in 1018, poor Chinese parents taught their children
              how to plant rice or weave silk, and wealthier parents taught
              their boys how to read the Confucian classics, write calligraphy
              or fight on horseback – and taught their girls to be modest and
              obedient housewives. It was obvious these skills would still be
              needed in 1050.

              In contrast, today we have no idea how China or the rest of the
              world will look in 2050. We don’t know what people will do for a
              living, we don’t know how armies or bureaucracies will function,
              and we don’t know what gender relations will be like. Some people
              will probably live much longer than today, and the human body
              itself might undergo an unprecedented revolution thanks to
              bioengineering and direct brain-computer interfaces. Much of what
              kids learn today will likely be irrelevant by 2050.

              At present, too many schools focus on cramming information. In the
              past this made sense, because information was scarce, and even the
              slow trickle of existing information was repeatedly blocked by
              censorship. If you lived, say, in a small provincial town in
              Mexico in 1800, it was difficult for you to know much about the
              wider world. There was no radio, television, daily newspapers or
              public libraries. Even if you were literate and had access to a
              private library, there was not much to read other than novels and
              religious tracts. The Spanish Empire heavily censored all texts
              printed locally, and allowed only a dribble of vetted publications
              to be imported from outside. Much the same was true if you lived
              in some provincial town in Russia, India, Turkey or China. When
              modern schools came along, teaching every child to read and write
              and imparting the basic facts of geography, history and biology,
              they represented an immense improvement.

              In contrast, in the 21st century we are flooded by enormous
              amounts of information, and even the censors don’t try to block
              it. Instead, they are busy spreading misinformation or distracting
              us with irrelevancies. If you live in some provincial Mexican town
              and you have a smartphone, you can spend many lifetimes just
              reading Wikipedia, watching TED talks, and taking free online
              courses. No government can hope to conceal all the information it
              doesn’t like. On the other hand, it is alarmingly easy to inundate
              the public with conflicting reports and red herrings. People all
              over the world are but a click away from the latest accounts of
              the bombardment of Aleppo or of melting ice caps in the Arctic,
              but there are so many contradictory accounts that it is hard to
              know what to believe. Besides, countless other things are just a
              click away, making it difficult to focus, and when politics or
              science look too complicated it is tempting to switch to funny cat
              videos, celebrity gossip or porn.

              In such a world, the last thing a teacher needs to give her pupils
              is more information. They already have far too much of it.
              Instead, people need the ability to make sense of information, to
              tell the difference between what is important and what is
              unimportant, and above all to combine many bits of information
              into a broad picture of the world.

              In truth, this has been the ideal of western liberal education for
              centuries, but up till now even many western schools have been
              rather slack in fulfilling it. Teachers allowed themselves to
              focus on shoving data while encouraging pupils “to think for
              themselves”. Due to their fear of authoritarianism, liberal
              schools had a particular horror of grand narratives. They assumed
              that as long as we give students lots of data and a modicum of
              freedom, the students will create their own picture of the world,
              and even if this generation fails to synthesise all the data into
              a coherent and meaningful story of the world, there will be plenty
              of time to construct a good synthesis in the future. We have now
              run out of time. The decisions we will take in the next few
              decades will shape the future of life itself, and we can take
              these decisions based only on our present world view. If this
              generation lacks a comprehensive view of the cosmos, the future of
              life will be decided at random.

              There's an emerging market called Dataism, which venerates neither
              gods nor man - it worships data. From a Dataist perspective, we
              may interpret the entire human species as a single data-processing
              system, with individual humans serving as its chips. If so, we can
              also understand the whole of history as a process of improving the
              efficiency of this system, through four basic methods:

              WHERE HAS ALL THE POWER GONE?
            </h2>
            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              **1.**Increasing the number of processors. A city of 100,000
              people has more computing power than a village of 1,000 people.
              **2.**Increasing the variety of processors. Different processors
              may use diverse ways to calculate and analyse data. Using several
              kinds of processors in a single system may therefore increase its
              dynamism and creativity. A conversation between a peasant, a
              priest and a physician may produce novel ideas that would never
              emerge from a conversation between three hunter-gatherers.
              **3.**Increasing the number of connections between processors.
              There is little point in increasing the mere number and variety of
              processors if they are poorly connected. A trade network linking
              ten cities is likely to result in many more economic,
              technological and social innovations than ten isolated cities.
              **4.**Increasing the freedom of movement along existing
              connections. Connecting processors is hardly useful if data cannot
              flow freely. Just building roads between ten cities won't be very
              useful if they are plagued by robbers, or if some autocratic
              despot doesn't allow merchants and travellers to move as they
              wish.
            </p>
            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              These four methods often contradict one another. The greater the
              number and variety of processors, the harder it is to freely
              connect them. The construction of the sapiens data-processing
              system accordingly passed through four main stages, each of which
              was characterised by an emphasis on different methods.
            </p>
            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              The first stage began with the cognitive revolution, which made it
              possible to connect unlimited sapiens into a single
              data-processing network. This gave sapiens an advantage over all
              other human and animal species. Although there is a limit to the
              number of Neanderthals, chimpanzees or elephants you can connect
              to the same net, there is no limit to the number of sapiens.
            </p>
            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              Sapiens used their advantage in data processing to overrun the
              entire world. However, as they spread into different lands and
              climates they lost touch with one another, and underwent diverse
              cultural transformations. The result was an immense variety of
              human cultures, each with its own lifestyle, behaviour patterns
              and world view. Hence the first phase of history involved an
              increase in the number and variety of human processors, at the
              expense of connectivity: 20,000 years ago there were many more
              sapiens than 70,000 years ago, and sapiens in Europe processed
              information differently from sapiens in China. However, there were
              no connections between people in Europe and China, and it would
              have seemed utterly impossible that all sapiens may one day be
              part of a single data-processing web.
            </p>
            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              The second stage began with agriculture and continued until the
              invention of writing and money. Agriculture accelerated
              demographic growth, so the number of human processors rose
              sharply, while simultaneously enabling many more people to live
              together in the same place, thereby generating dense local
              networks that contained an unprecedented number of processors. In
              addition, agriculture created new incentives and opportunities for
              different networks to trade and communicate.
            </p>
            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              Nevertheless, during the second phase, centrifugal forces remained
              predominant. In the absence of writing and money, humans could not
              establish cities, kingdoms or empires. Humankind was still divided
              into innumerable little tribes, each with its own lifestyle and
              world view. Uniting the whole of humankind was not even a fantasy.

            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              The third stage kicked off with the appearance of writing and
              money about 5,000 years ago, and lasted until the beginning of the
              scientific revolution. Thanks to writing and money, the
              gravitational field of human co-operation finally overpowered the
              centrifugal forces. Human groups bonded and merged to form cities
              and kingdoms. Political and commercial links between different
              cities and kingdoms also tightened. At least since the first
              millennium BC - when coinage, empires, and universal religions
              appeared - humans began to consciously dream about forging a
              single network that would encompass the entire globe.
            </p>
            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              This dream became a reality during the fourth and last stage of
              history, which began around 1492. Early modern explorers,
              conquerors and traders wove the first thin threads that
              encompassed the whole world. In the late modern period, these
              threads were made stronger and denser, so that the spider's web of
              Columbus's days became the steel and asphalt grid of the 21st
              century. Even more importantly, information was allowed to flow
              increasingly freely along this global grid. When Columbus first
              hooked up the Eurasian net to the American net, only a few bits of
              data could cross the ocean each year, running the gauntlet of
              cultural prejudices, strict censorship and political repression.
            </p>
            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              But as the years went by, the free market, the scientific
              community, the rule of law and the spread of democracy all helped
              to lift the barriers. We often imagine that democracy and the free
              market won because they were "good". In truth, they won because
              they improved the global data-processing system.

            <p className="my-5 text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-xl text-justify">
              So over the last 70,000 years humankind first spread out, then
              separated into distinct groups and finally merged again. Yet the
              process of unification did not take us back to the beginning. When
              the different human groups fused into the global village of today,
              each brought along its unique legacy of thoughts, tools and
              behaviours, which it collected and developed along the way. Our
              modern larders are now stuffed with Middle Eastern wheat, Andean
              potatoes, New Guinean sugar and Ethiopian coffee. Similarly, our
              language, religion, music and politics are replete with heirlooms

              called the Internet-of-All-Things. Once this mission is
              accomplished, Homo sapiens will vanish.
